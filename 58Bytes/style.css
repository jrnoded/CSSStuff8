  58 bytes of CSS to look great nearly everywhere
  See: https://gist.github.com/JoeyBurzynski/617fb6201335779f8424ad9528b72c41

  When making this website, I wanted a simple, reasonable way to make it 
  look good on most displays. Not counting any minimization techniques, 
  the following 58 bytes worked well for me:

  html {
    max-width: 38rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    margin: auto;
  }

  let's break this down:

  max-width: 38rem
  it appears that the default font size for most browsers is 16px, so 38rem is 608px. 
  supporting 600px displays at a minimum seems reasonable.

  padding: 2rem
  if the display's width goes under 38rem, then this padding keeps things looking 
  pretty good until around 256px. while this may seem optional, it actually hits 
  two birds with one stone - the padding also provides sorely-needed top and bottom 
  whitespace.

  margin: auto
  this is really all that is needed to center the page, because main is a block 
  element under semantic html5.

  a key insight: it took me a surprising number of iterations to arrive at this point. 
  perhaps that speaks to the fact that i know nothing about "modern" web development, 
  or, as i'm more inclined to believe, just how hard it is to keep it simple in a world 
  of complication.

  update 1: following some discussion, I've since changed the padding to 1.5rem for a 
  happier compromise between mobile and desktop displays.

  update 2: the ch unit was brought to my attention, and I quite like it! I've since 
  changed to 70ch/2ch, which looks nearly the same with 2 less bytes, except that the 
  padding is a little bit smaller (a good thing for mobile).



  100 Bytes of CSS to look great everywhere (enhanced version)

  html {
    max-width: 70ch;
    padding: 3em 1em;
    margin: auto;
    line-height: 1.75;
    font-size: 1.25em;
  }

  This should be simple drop-in css to look good on most displays.

  Let's break this down. I've adapted the original text with my own commentary.

  max-width: 70ch
  the "readable range" is usually 60-80 character widths, and CSS lets you express that 
  directly with the ch unit.

  padding: 3em 1em
  If the display's width goes under the max-width set above, then this padding prevents 
  edge-to-edge text on mobile. We use 3em to provide top/bottom whitespace.

  margin: auto
  This is really all that is needed to center the page - applied on html, because Dan's 
  site doesnt have a semantic tag and is more likely to exist in most sites. That the 
  top tag centers itself relative to nothing is unintuitive, but thats how browsers do.
  
  line-height: 1.75
  Spacing between the lines to help increase visual clarity. Always leave line height 
  unitless because reasons.

  font-size: 1.5em
  I've noticed that recent design trends and screen sizes have tended toward bigger font sizes. 
  Or maybe I'm getting old. Prefer em or rem over px if you want to let users scale it.

  You can use :root instead of <html> to guarantee that there is some selector present, 
  but its a touch too fancy for me and uses an extra character :)
