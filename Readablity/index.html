                Brad Scott and Elliott Scott of Applied Design Works were concerned about typefaces that look a little like old ransom notes, where each letter
                and number were dramatically different from each other. They wondered if, despite designers’ intentions, these typefaces could actually be more
                difficult to read for some people. They decided that no existing typeface met their legibility, readability, and branding goals. So they
                endeavored to create a new typeface called Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the Braille Institute’s founder J. Robert Atkinson.
